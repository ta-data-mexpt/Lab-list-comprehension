    "As you continue improving your Python programming skills, you will encounter useful ways to combine some of the basic concepts you learned earlier in the program. In this lesson, we will learn about list comprehensions. List comprehensions combine the concepts of storage in data structures, iteration, and even conditional logic into an efficient form.\n",
    "Combining Storage and Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea behind list comprehensions is iterative storage. In some of the previous lessons, we have encountered scenarios where we had to create an empty list and iterate through a for loop appending a value to the list at the end of each iteration."

We could use a list comprehension with an endswith('.csv') condition in it to get a list of just the CSV files in that directory. We could use another list comprehension to have Pandas read each of those files and then the pd.concat method to combine them all into a single data set that we can analyze as follows. "
